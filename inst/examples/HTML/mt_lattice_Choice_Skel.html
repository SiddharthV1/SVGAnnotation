<p> This example illustrates how to mix controls in HTML and a
plot in SVG.  The SVG plot is a lattice plot where each point is labeled
with a unique id that identifies its panel and group, e.g. 
"1-2-3" is the id of the third point in the second group (six cylinder cars) in the first panel.
Within the HTML document, we have a choice menu with which the user can
select a cylinder (four, six, or eight).  When a cylinder is selected, a
Javascript function (showChoice) in the HTML document is invoked and
that gets a handle to the SVG document and then gets the points via
their <b>id</b> attributes and sets their style to make them stand out. Also, the previous selection of points have their style reset to the original value. 
</p>

<p>
The showChoice function gets the SVG document object by
<ol>
  <li> accessing the embeds array of the HTML document</li>
  <li> calling getSVGDocument() on the generic emebedded object</li>
      to treat it as an SVG document.
</ol>
At this point, we are back into regular ECMAScript code we would
use within an HTML or SVG document.
</p>

<form>
Choose number of gears: <select name="gear" onchange="showChoice(this)">
    <option value="0" default="true">Select</option>
    <option value="1">three</option>
    <option value="2">four</option>
    <option value="3">five</option>        
</select>
</form>

<object id="latticePlot" data="mt_lattice_Choice.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="960" height="768"> 
</object>
