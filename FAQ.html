   Q. 1
I put my SVG files on the Web in compress form (i.e. .svgz),
but browsers don't seem to be able to view them but want the 
viewer to save the file.
<dd class="answer">
   A. 
Your web server needs to tell the requester that the file
is compressed SVG. It does this by returning the correct
Content-Type in the header of the HTTP response.
You need to tell your web server about these files.
Add 

<pre class="programlisting">
AddType image/svg+xml .svg .svgz
AddEncoding x-gzip .svgz
</pre>

to the &lt;VirtualHost&gt; stanza in your httpd.conf file.
(See <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_mime.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_mime.html</a>.)

Alternatively, you can add it to an .htaccess within a directory to
have it apply to it and all sub-directories.  That directory must be
configured in the server to allow .htaccess, i.e. the server has to
know to read the .htaccess file.
Note that the server must return a Content-Encoding of
x-gzip and not gzip for Firefox to understand the type correctly.
Opera understands both forms.

   Q. 2
I've included the AddType and AddEncoding directives in the Apache
configuration. However, things still don't work.
<dd class="answer">
   A. 
Make certain to clear your cache. Your browser is still
probably 
I use 
<div class="codeToggle"><div class="unhidden" id="idp6322944"><div><pre class="rcode" title="R code">
library(RCurl)
x = getURLContent(u, .opts = list(verbose = TRUE), binary = TRUE)
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="clearFloat"></div>
to look at the header of the response to see what is happening.
You can also use the Live HTTP Headers extension for Firefox.

   Q. 3
I can read .svgz files from the Web but not locally.
<dd class="answer">
   A. 
It is not clear that Firefox has support for this yet.
Opera does.

   Q. 4
Tooltips. How do I get these to work for different browsers?

<dd class="answer">
   A. 
Within a path, for Opera, specify a title node as a child of path with the text of the tooltip.
For Firefox, put a xlink:title attribute on the path.
For Webkit (Safari and Google Chrome), enclose the path element within an
a element with a xlink:title attribute.

<p>
We can refer to a CSS with a relative file name,
a full path name,
file:///Users/duncan/Rpackages/SVGAnnotation/CSS/RSVGPlot.css
or
file://localhost/Users/duncan/Rpackages/SVGAnnotation/CSS/RSVGPlot.css
